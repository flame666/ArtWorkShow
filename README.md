# ArtWorkShow

A toy project build for my girlfriend to exhibit her art work

# Feature
1. Simple to use, just need to rename the image file and folder according to their order (1.png,2.png and so on), for example, to change the logo of line 1, put your rename images in preview_img"/1, the logo will be show by their numeric order.
2. To add slides of each work, put numeric order image files in "work" floder, for example, slides in floder work/1_1 will be showed after you click the first logo image on first line.

# How my girlfriend said about it
1. The design of this project is inspires by the website of BIG, it's a classical minimalist design.
2. Extremly easy to use! A very good choice for designers who wants to show their porfolio online!
