# ArtWorkShow

A toy project build for my girlfriend to exhibit her artwork

# Feature
1. Simple to use, just need to rename the image file and folder according to their order (1.png,2.png and so on), for example, to change the logo of line 1, put your rename images in preview_img"/1, the logo will be shown by their numeric order.
2. To add slides of each work, put numeric order image files in "work" folder, for example, slides in folder work/1_1 will be showed after you click the first logo image on the first line.

# How my girlfriend said about it
1. The design of this project is inspired by the website of BIG, it's a classic minimalist design.
2. Extremely easy to use! A very good choice for designers who want to show their portfolio online!
